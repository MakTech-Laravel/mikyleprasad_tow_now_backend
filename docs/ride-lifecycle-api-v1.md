# API v1 Ride Lifecycle

This document describes the user, driver, and admin ride lifecycle endpoints and the enforced business rules.

## Business Rules

- A user can request rides only from approved, non-suspended drivers.
- A user can have only one `active` ride at a time.
- A driver can have only one `active` ride at a time.
- A user cannot create duplicate `pending` requests to the same driver.
- When one `pending` ride is accepted, all competing `pending` rides for the same user or same driver are auto-marked as `system_cancelled`.
- `system_cancelled` rides are hidden from role detail/list endpoints.
- Allowed flow is `pending -> active -> completed/cancelled`.
- No downgrade is allowed (an `active` ride cannot go back to `pending`).
- `completed`, `system_cancelled`, and `expired` are terminal and immutable.
- Ride request expiry is config-driven:
  - config key: `rides.request_expire_minutes`
  - env key: `RIDE_REQUEST_EXPIRE_MINUTES`
  - default: `10`
- Pending rides past `expired_at` are automatically marked `expired` by scheduler.

## Scheduler / Expiry

- Scheduled command: `rides:expire-pending`
- Schedule frequency: every minute
- Implementation:
  - command dispatches `ExpirePendingRidesJob`
  - job calls `RideLifecycleService::expirePendingRides()`

## Driver Endpoints (`/api/v1/driver`)

### GET `/stats`
Driver ride summary.

### GET `/rides`
List driver rides by tab/status.

Query params:
- `tab` (`pending|active|history`)

Body:
```json
{
  "eta_minutes": 15

```

### POST `/rides/{ride}/eta`

## Admin Endpoints (`/api/v1/admin`)

Admin ride endpoints remain read-only:

- GET `/stats`
- GET `/rides`
- GET `/rides/{ride}`
- GET `/drivers`
- GET `/customers`

`system_cancelled` rides are excluded from list/detail views.

## Timeline Tracking

Ride timeline updates are logged in `ride_histories`:

- `status` entries for state transitions
- `estimated_time` entries for initial ETA and ETA updates
- `complete` entries for completion

`RideResource` exposes:
- `timeline.eta_updates_count` (when histories are loaded)
